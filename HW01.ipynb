      "A new kind of illness is found. It called flying phobia. Based on daistionary (daisy dictionary), flying phobia is an unusual fear of flying. Well, this kind off illness appears after all of the accident happened to our commercial airlines company. I am really afraid to fly now. I think it is not only me that being afraid of flying, but also most of Indonesian people. Since the missing of Adam Air on January, I and my friends are afraid to fly. One of my friends prefer to have a long trip by car than flying, when she wants to go back to Bandung, although it takes almost 16 hours to go there from Situbondo. She is really afraid to fly. She thinks it is far better for her to have a hot seat, 16 hours of bended legs, than takes an only 1 our of flying to Bandung.Â \n",
      "\n",
      "The story is not yet end. The missing of Adam Air is followed with the landing problem of Lion Air and the cracking of Adam Air\u0019s body. It fears me more, but I just think that it is because the low cost airlines maybe decrease the maintenance, so the quality is not guaranteed anymore. But, I still brave enough to fly if I use the \u0018normal cost\u0019 (premium) airlines like Garuda\n",
      "Indonesia.Â \n",
      "Yeah& but look, what have just happened! My last trusted airline is crashed last Wednesday. So, to which airlines I can trust again? How can I still want to fly anymore?Â  I still love my life and soul&Â \n",

      "Surabaya by plane. She asks me to work in\n",
      "Surabaya if I once graduated. She really worries if I choose to work in another place outside\n",
      "Surabaya. She just can\u0019t imagine how if I should go there by plane. Well, I think it\u0019s really humane now if people have a flying phobia like me, my friend, or my mom did. Huh& How can we not afraid to fly right now? If there\u0019s no improvement in our transportation systems and qualities, I thought I will spend my whole life just only in\n",
